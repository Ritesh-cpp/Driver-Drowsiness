# Driver-Drowsiness
A major cause of road accidents throughout the world is driver drowsiness and fatigue.
With the help of machine learning, we have created a driver drowsiness detection system which will monitor the face of the driver and raise an alarm when his eyes close for a period of time or when he yawns.
We have used OpenCV and Haar cascades and pre-trained dlib library.
We have proposed a model using Raspberry Pi and 5MP raspberry pi camera module and buzzer and 16x2 LCD display.
